== -Tasks.- Lists of stuff that I'm too lazy to do RIGHT NOW

Easy & fun (but i'm probably doing it right now)

 * Check for BS.pack/unpack and replace w/utf8-string calls, where applicable
 * Replace maybe's w/cases
 * Add option to hell-dir to check hashes
 * Add option to it to force reinserting
 * Add more comments to meta methods and such
 * s/String/JPathlike/
 * Write help for hell-dir
 * .hell-ignore
 * Meta links instead of current crap

Boring

 * Move everyting to Error data type
 * Rework URI parsing so it's possible to use node as authority (hellchunk: scheme, etc)
 * "Hashed" schema
 * Sizes!

Non-trivial

 * Protect (more) against connecting to localhost
 * Logging
 * Transactional inserts

Requires more thinking

 * Other ways of exchanging data than HTTP
 * Better node discovery (nodelists?)

Real Massive

 * ECRS' scheme for meta lookups. Probably requires implementation of cross-platform random generator and digital signatures
 * Tracking

Not sure if it's worth it

 * Cryptographic mechanism of identifying node
 * Active Meta-updating (Metamail)
 * [hell-dir] Add indexes to check for changed files (?)

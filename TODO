== Tasks.

Trivial

 * Catch nodelist's parser errors (fails when shit is on nodelist)
 * reorganize findChunks / findChunk, they are not optimal. Use Eithers (with unfetched lists) instead of Maybes

Non-trivial

 * Encryption (AES, i think)
 * Decoy downloads

Slightly harder

 * Multiple downloads at time

Requires more thinking
 
 * Metachunks

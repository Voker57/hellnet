== Tasks.

Trivial

 * Catch nodelist's parser errors (fails when shit is on nodelist)
 * Make hell-fsck command to check the store for inconsistency

Non-trivial

 * Fix APIs (use consistant types' policy, find/locate/fetch)

Slightly harder

 * Multiple downloads at time (doen, unchecked)

Requires more thinking

 * Node discovery
 * Better meta exchange protocol

== Tasks.

Easy & fun (but i'm probably doing it right now)

 * Check for BS.pack/unpack and replace w/utf8-string calls, where applicable
 * Order exports
 * Replace maybe's w/cases

-Trivial- Boring

 * Move everyting to Error data type
 * -Out-of-store file insertion-
 * Directory locking
 * Rework URI parsing so it's possible to use node as authority (hellchunk: scheme, etc)
 * Sizes!

Non-trivial

 * Active Meta-updating (Metamail)
 * Protect (more) against connecting to localhost
 * Logging

Slightly harder

 -

Requires more thinking

 * Other ways of exchanging data than HTTP
 * Digital signatures
 * Cryptographic mechanism of identifying node

Real Massive

 * ECRS' scheme for meta lookups. Probably requires implementation of cross-platform random generator and digital signatures
 * Tracking

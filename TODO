-Trivial- Boring

 -

Non-trivial

 * Active Meta-updating (Metamail)
 * Protect (more) against connecting to localhost

Slightly harder

 * Multiple downloads at time (doen, unchecked)

Requires more thinking

 * Better meta exchange protocol
 * Other ways of exchanging data than HTTP
 * Digital signatures

Real Massive

 * ECRS' scheme for meta lookups. Probably requires implementation of cross-platform random generator and digital signatures

Hellnet is a project to create simple, anonymous, fast data sharing network. More info at [http://bitcheese.net/wiki/hellnet]

This is Hellnet implementation in Haskell, aka hspawn

== Building

You'll need cabal [http://www.haskell.org/cabal/] to build Hellnet from source. Hellnet requires packages base, Crypto, bytestring, pretty, filepath, directory, HTT to build and additionally Lucu is required for hell-serve.

Just run
% runhaskell Setup.hs configure
% runhaskell Setup.hs build
% runhaskell Setup.hs install

== Usage

=== Storage and retrieval

hell-insert <file> -- insert file into local DB. You are given hash which you can use to later retrieve it.

Example:

% hell-insert COPYING
COPYING: 361e6d35ac16281294314c5b40b57ccd3f0d5e6ab2ed6088e346f8e181ec4c89ac141a9a786a1f0afc454610f4db8c00af98272f44490a6f601fa08293a13be9

hell-get file <hash> -- retrieve file by its hash, using local DB and remote nodes (if available). File contents are written to STDIN.

Example:

hell-get 361e6d35ac16281294314c5b40b57ccd3f0d5e6ab2ed6088e346f8e181ec4c89ac141a9a786a1f0afc454610f4db8c00af98272f44490a6f601fa08293a13be9 > COPYING

=== Remote nodes

hell-nodes list -- list all known nodes. They are searched for data chunks.
hell-nodes add <hostname> <port> -- add node to list
hell-nodes rm <hostname> <port> -- delete node from list
hell-nodes clear -- clear the nodelist

hell-serve [<port>] -- launches Hellnet server on <port>. Default port is 6666. Server is not required to download data, just to share it.
